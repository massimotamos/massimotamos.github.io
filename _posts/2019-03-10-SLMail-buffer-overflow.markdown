For this excercise I followed step by step the guide provided by vulp3cula. 

You can find his guide here:

[buffer-overflow](https://vulp3cula.gitbook.io/hackers-grimoire/exploitation/buffer-overflow
)

* Why is his work good?
* Because it allows you to understand:
	* How, of course, but more important:
	* Why

In fact I looked around and I could not find the how and the why so well integrated as in his work!
