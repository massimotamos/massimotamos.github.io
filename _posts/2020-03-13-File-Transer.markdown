# Download with wget

### Continue an Incomplete Download
``
wget -c file
``

### Mirror an Entire Website
``
wget -m http://example.com
``

options:

* ``--convert-links`` changes links inside each downloaded page so that they point to each other, not the web.

* ``--page-requisites`` downloads things like style sheets, so pages will look correct offline.
* ``--no-parent`` stops wget from downloading parent sites. So if you want to download http://example.com/subexample, you wonâ€™t end up with the parent page.

### Download an Entire Directory
``
wget -r ftp://example.com/folder
``

### Download a List of Files at Once
``
wget -i download.txt
``

Few other options:

* ``-b`` :run then download in the background.
* ``-t 10`` :keep trying to download even if there is a 404 error. will try to download 10 times;
* ``--limit-rate=200k`` :Limit the download bandwidth speed at 200KB/s.

### TFTP (Windows XP & Windows 2003)
A TFTP client is installed by default on windows machines up to Windows XP and Windows 2003. What is good about TFTP is that you can use it non-interactively. Which means less risk of losing your shell.
